# Coded Glass
Immersive Scholar web display featuring content from Liss LaFleur's Coded Glass project.

## Notes
Designed for both non-interactive large-scale displays and interactive personal
devices (i.e. desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones) but not optimized for all
sizes and aspect ratios yet.

Here, a "large-scale display" is defined as a screen with a viewport height
greater than or equal to 2100px (vh â‰¥ 2100px). Anything below 2100px high is
considered a "personal device" screen size.
